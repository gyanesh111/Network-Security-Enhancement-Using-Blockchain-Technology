# Network-Security-Enhancement-Using-Blockchain-Technology
Developed a mechanism to enhance the security of Wireless Sensor Networks by implementing Blockchain technology, hence encrypting input data using SHA-512 and RSA algorithms. HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap are used for frontend, Ethereum platform and Python are used for backend.
This is my Mtech major project. I have developed a working model of this project.
Overview of this project: 
Collected data from the wsn and stored them in the blockchain to provide security. Then later access the data using the login module. In this way I implemented the triple layer security.
